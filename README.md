## Overview
This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. We aim to segment the Customers based on RFM so that the company can target its customers efficiently.

Which customers are the most valuable customers? In other words, the total amount of consumption is the highest in a specific time frame. What are the customers characteristics of these high-value customers?
Which customers are the most loyal customers(the customers with the highest repurchase rate)?
